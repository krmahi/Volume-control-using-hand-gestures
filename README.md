# Volume_control_using_hand_gestures

The idea behind this project is that, with the help of Thumb, index and pinky 
fingers we will increase and decrease the volume of our computer/laptop. 
When the pinky finger down then we will increase and decrease the volume 
with the help of thumb and index finger. Once pinky finger up then it will set 
the volume of the computer, means that we will change volume with thumb 
and index finger but we will set the volume with pinky finger.
```
➢ It helps computer to understand human body language.
➢ It is very easy to use and hassle free.
➢ Calculate the distance between thumb tip and index finger tip
